Installation:
-------------

The following Python libraries are required: numpy, scipy, networkx, cvxpy.  To build the library cfh.so, modify the file Makefile.inc as necessary and then run make.  This build requires the Cython compiler.

Usage:
------

Usage information can be obtained by running either of the main scripts, fh_solve_convex.py and fh_solve_coex.py, with the --help flag.  Example input files (specifying equimolar target phases) are provided in the examples/ directory.  These example design problems can be solved in two steps as follows:

  cd examples/
  python3 ../fh_solve_convex.py example-targets-N4.txt ridge --output=example-targets-N4-solutions.p.gz
  python3 ../fh_solve_coex.py example-targets-N4-solutions.p.gz
